I have made a code for a game called 'Bulls and cows' known for '야구게임'. Where player gets to play with computer with difficulties 'easy' or 'hard'.

The rule is simple.
1. Each player(computer) picks a 4 digit number where all digits are unique and leading zero is allowed.
2. Take turns predicting your opponent's number
3. After each guess, opponent gives feedback:
   
  Bulls: Number of digits that are correct and in the correct position.
  Cows: Number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position.
